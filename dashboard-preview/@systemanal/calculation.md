## Calculation Logic Framework

### 3-Tier Hierarchy System

#### Tier 1: Global Banking Standards (Fallback)
- **Source**: Bank of Israel official regulations (Updated January 2025)
- **Usage**: When bank-specific configuration is missing
- **Current Official Standards**:
  - **Maximum LTV Ratios**: 
    - First-time homebuyers (citizens): 75%
    - Foreign residents: 50%
    - Housing improvements: 70%
    - Second properties: 50%
  - **DTI Limit**: 40% maximum (Bank of Israel regulated)
  - **Prime Rate Structure**: Limited to 66% of total mortgage
  - **Fixed Rate Requirement**: Minimum 33% of mortgage must be fixed
  - **Current BOI Interest Rate**: 4.5% (as of November 2024)
  - **Inflation Rate**: 3.5% (above target range)
  - **Standard Processing Fee**: 1,500 NIS

#### Tier 2: Bank-Specific Configurations (Primary)
- **Source**: Individual bank lending policies
- **Usage**: Primary calculation parameters
- **Precedence**: Overrides global standards
- **Examples**:
  - Bank Hapoalim: 3.18% base rate, 80% max LTV
  - Bank Leumi: 3.25% base rate, 75% max LTV

#### Tier 3: Customer-Specific Adjustments (Final)
- **Source**: Customer profile analysis
- **Usage**: Final rate and amount adjustments
- **Factors**: Credit score, income stability, debt ratios

### Core Calculation Metrics

#### 1. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio
```
LTV = (Requested Loan Amount / Property Value) × 100
```

**Decision Logic**:
- LTV ≤ Bank's max_ltv_ratio → CONTINUE
- LTV > Bank's max_ltv_ratio → REJECT

**Example**:
- Requested: 1,000,000 NIS
- Property Value: 1,300,000 NIS
- LTV = (1,000,000 / 1,300,000) × 100 = 76.92%
- Bank Hapoalim max LTV: 80% → APPROVED
- Bank Leumi max LTV: 75% → REJECTED

#### 2. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
```
Monthly Payment = (Loan Amount × Monthly Interest Rate) / (1 - (1 + Monthly Interest Rate)^(-Loan Term))
DTI = ((Monthly Payment + Existing Debts) / Monthly Income) × 100
```

**Decision Logic** (Bank of Israel Official Regulation):
- DTI ≤ 40% → APPROVED (BOI regulatory limit)
- DTI > 40% → REJECTED (Exceeds BOI maximum)

**Note**: The Bank of Israel strictly limits debt-to-income ratio to 40% maximum. This is a hard regulatory requirement that cannot be exceeded by any bank.

**Example**:
- Loan: 1,000,000 NIS at 3.5% for 25 years
- Monthly Payment: ≈ 5,000 NIS
- Existing Debts: 2,000 NIS
- Monthly Income: 25,000 NIS
- DTI = ((5,000 + 2,000) / 25,000) × 100 = 28% → APPROVED

## Bank Competition Algorithm

### Processing Flow

#### Step 1: Application Validation
1. Verify minimum loan amount requirements
2. Check maximum loan amount limits
3. Validate property value and LTV feasibility
4. Confirm customer eligibility criteria

#### Step 2: Bank Eligibility Check
For each active bank:
1. **Credit Score Filter**: customer_credit_score ≥ bank.min_credit_score
2. **Loan Amount Filter**: bank.min_loan_amount ≤ requested_amount ≤ bank.max_loan_amount
3. **LTV Filter**: calculated_ltv ≤ bank.max_ltv_ratio

#### Step 3: Risk Assessment
1. **Calculate DTI ratio** using bank's interest rate
2. **Determine risk category**:
   - Low Risk: DTI ≤ 30%, Credit Score ≥ 750
   - Medium Risk: DTI 30-40%, Credit Score 650-749
   - High Risk: DTI 40-50%, Credit Score 600-649
   - Unacceptable: DTI > 50% or Credit Score < 600

#### Step 4: Rate Calculation
```
Final Rate = Base Rate + Risk Premium + Market Adjustment
```

**Risk Premium Table**:
| Risk Level | Premium |
|------------|---------|
| Low Risk | 0.0% |
| Medium Risk | +0.2% |
| High Risk | +0.5% |

#### Step 5: Competitive Ranking
Banks are ranked by:
1. **Primary**: Final interest rate (ascending)
2. **Secondary**: Processing fees (ascending)
3. **Tertiary**: Maximum loan amount (descending)

## Decision Cases and Examples

### Case 1: Standard Approval - Multiple Bank Competition
**Customer Profile**:
- Requested Amount: 800,000 NIS
- Property Value: 1,200,000 NIS
- Monthly Income: 30,000 NIS
- Existing Debts: 3,000 NIS
- Credit Score: 720

**Calculations**:
- LTV = (800,000 / 1,200,000) × 100 = 66.67%
- All banks accept (LTV < 75-80%)

**Bank Responses**:
| Bank | Base Rate | Risk Premium | Final Rate | DTI | Status |
|------|-----------|--------------|------------|-----|--------|
| Mizrahi Tefahot | 3.15% | +0.2% | 3.35% | 26.8% | APPROVED |
| Bank Hapoalim | 3.18% | +0.2% | 3.38% | 27.1% | APPROVED |
| Bank Leumi | 3.25% | +0.2% | 3.45% | 27.6% | APPROVED |

**Winner**: Mizrahi Tefahot (lowest rate)

### Case 2: High LTV Rejection
**Customer Profile**:
- Requested Amount: 1,000,000 NIS
- Property Value: 1,300,000 NIS
- Monthly Income: 25,000 NIS
- Credit Score: 680

**Calculations**:
- LTV = (1,000,000 / 1,300,000) × 100 = 76.92%

**Bank Responses**:
| Bank | Max LTV | LTV Check | Status | Reason |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Bank Hapoalim | 80% | 76.92% ≤ 80% | APPROVED | Meets LTV requirement |
| Bank Leumi | 75% | 76.92% > 75% | REJECTED | Exceeds LTV limit |
| Discount Bank | 75% | 76.92% > 75% | REJECTED | Exceeds LTV limit |

**Result**: Only Bank Hapoalim approves

### Case 3: High DTI Rejection (Bank of Israel Limit)
**Customer Profile**:
- Requested Amount: 1,200,000 NIS
- Property Value: 1,600,000 NIS
- Monthly Income: 20,000 NIS
- Existing Debts: 4,000 NIS
- Credit Score: 750

**Calculations**:
- LTV = (1,200,000 / 1,600,000) × 100 = 75% ✓
- Monthly Payment ≈ 6,000 NIS
- DTI = ((6,000 + 4,000) / 20,000) × 100 = 50%

**Bank Responses**:
| Bank | BOI DTI Limit | Customer DTI | Status | Reason |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| All Banks | 40% max | 50% | REJECTED | Exceeds BOI regulatory limit |

**Result**: Universal rejection due to DTI exceeding Bank of Israel's 40% maximum limit. Customer must either:
1. Increase down payment to reduce loan amount
2. Increase monthly income
3. Reduce existing debts
4. Consider lower-priced property

### Case 4: Credit Score Rejection
**Customer Profile**:
- Requested Amount: 600,000 NIS
- Property Value: 1,000,000 NIS
- Monthly Income: 25,000 NIS
- Credit Score: 580

**Bank Responses**:
| Bank | Min Credit Score | Customer Score | Status |
|------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| All Banks | 600-650 | 580 | REJECTED |

**Result**: Universal rejection due to insufficient credit score
