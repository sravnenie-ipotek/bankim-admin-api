# Logo Assets

## ✅ Logo Successfully Integrated!

The primary SVG logo has been successfully integrated into the SharedHeader component.

**Current logo files:**

- ✅ Served from public folder (`/assets/images/logo.svg`)
- ✅ Properly sized (96x42.86px on desktop)
- ✅ Responsive (scales down on mobile devices)
- ✅ Clickable with navigation functionality
- ✅ Has hover effect (slight scale animation)
- ✅ Vite-compatible (no import issues)
