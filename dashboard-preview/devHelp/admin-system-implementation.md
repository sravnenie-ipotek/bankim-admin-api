#### **State Management:**
```typescript
interface AdminState {
  user: {
    role: 'bank-employee' | 'sales-manager';
    permissions: Permission[];
    currentService: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  };
  clients: ClientState;
  offers: OfferState;
  programs: ProgramState;
  notifications: NotificationState;
}
```

#### **Routing Structure:**
```typescript
const adminRoutes = {
  '/admin': {
    component: AdminLayout,
    children: [
      '/dashboard': RoleDashboard,
      '/clients': ClientManagement,
      '/clients/:id': ClientDetails,

-- Admin Users
CREATE TABLE admin_users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role admin_role NOT NULL,
  bank_id UUID REFERENCES banks(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Role Permissions
CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  role admin_role NOT NULL,
  service_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  permission_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
