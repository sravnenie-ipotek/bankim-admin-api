### Connection Strategy Details

#### **Development Layer (Single Source)**
```yaml
Repository: bankim-admin-workspace
Contains: packages/client + packages/server + packages/shared + docs + scripts
Purpose: Unified development with hot reloading across packages
Access: All developers clone and work here exclusively
```

#### **Deployment Layer (3 Filtered Targets)**
```yaml
Dashboard Repository (bankim-admin-dashboard):
  Source: packages/client/ (filtered from workspace)
  Dependencies: @bankim/shared via git+https://
  Hosting: Static hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify)
  Update Trigger: npm run push:dashboard

API Repository (bankim-admin-api):
  Source: packages/server/ (filtered from workspace)  
  Dependencies: @bankim/shared via git+https://
  Hosting: Server hosting platforms (Railway, Heroku)
  Update Trigger: npm run push:api

Shared Repository (bankim-admin-shared):
  Source: packages/shared/ (filtered from workspace)
  Dependencies: Zero dependencies (pure package)
  Distribution: Git-based NPM package
  Update Trigger: npm run push:shared
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies & Workflows

### 1. **Unified Development Strategy**
```bash
# Single workspace for all development
git clone git@github.com:sravnenie-ipotek/bankim-admin-workspace-.git
cd bankim-admin-workspace-
npm install                     # Installs all package dependencies
npm run dev                     # Starts all packages with hot reloading
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single clone contains everything
- ✅ Hot reloading across all packages  
- ✅ Shared types work immediately
- ✅ Single command starts entire system
- ✅ Atomic commits across multiple packages

### 2. **Selective Deployment Strategy**
```bash
# Deploy only what changed
npm run push:dashboard          # Frontend changes only
npm run push:api               # Backend changes only  
npm run push:shared            # Shared types update only
npm run push:workspace         # Development workspace only
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Faster deployments (only changed components)
- 🎯 Isolated testing (deploy one component at a time)
- 🔄 Independent scaling (frontend/backend scale separately)
- 🚀 Flexible CI/CD (different pipelines per component)

### 3. **Complete Deployment Strategy**
```bash
# Deploy everything at once
npm run push:all               # Deploys to all 4 repositories

# What happens:
# 1. Builds shared package first (dependency)
# 2. Commits any uncommitted changes
# 3. Filters and pushes workspace content
# 4. Filters and pushes dashboard content  
# 5. Filters and pushes API content
# 6. Tags and pushes shared package
# 7. Verifies all deployments
```

**Benefits:**
- 🔄 Synchronized releases across all components
- ✅ Dependency consistency guaranteed
- 📦 Version alignment across packages
- 🎯 Single command for complete deployment

### 4. **Emergency Deployment Strategy**
```bash
# Hotfix workflow
npm run push:dashboard -m "Hotfix: critical UI bug"
npm run push:api -m "Hotfix: authentication issue"
npm run push:shared -m "Hotfix: type definition error"

# Rollback workflow
git reset --hard HEAD~1         # In specific deployment repo
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Re-deploy from workspace
npm run push:{component} --force
```

## 🔧 Technical Integration Patterns

### Dependency Resolution Pattern

#### **Development Environment**
```json
// packages/client/package.json & packages/server/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bankim/shared": "file:../shared"    // Local file reference
  }
}
```

#### **Deployment Environment**
```json
// Deployed package.json (auto-generated)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bankim/shared": "git+https://github.com/sravnenie-ipotek/bankim-admin-shared.git"
  }
}
```

### Package Filtering Process

#### **Dashboard Deployment Filtering**
```bash
# From workspace packages/client/ to bankim-admin-dashboard
1. Extract: src/, public/, cypress/, *.config.ts files
2. Transform: package.json (file:../shared → git+https://)
3. Exclude: node_modules/, development artifacts
4. Include: Production configuration and build scripts
```

#### **API Deployment Filtering**
```bash
# From workspace packages/server/ to bankim-admin-api  
1. Extract: *.js files, config/, database/, scripts/, migrations/
2. Transform: package.json (file:../shared → git+https://)
3. Exclude: node_modules/, logs/, development files
4. Include: Production startup and database scripts
```

#### **Shared Package Compilation**
```bash
# From workspace packages/shared/ to bankim-admin-shared
1. Compile: TypeScript src/ to JavaScript dist/ + .d.ts files
2. Create: Version tags (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
3. Generate: Production package.json
4. Include: README, CHANGELOG, compiled distribution only
```

## 🚨 Risk Management & Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Solutions

#### **Repository Sync Issues**
```yaml
Risk: Deployment repos get out of sync with workspace
Mitigation: Automated deployment scripts prevent manual changes
Recovery: Re-deploy from workspace overwrites any manual changes
Monitoring: Git remote checks and deployment verification
```

#### **Dependency Version Conflicts**
```yaml
Risk: Shared package versions become inconsistent
Mitigation: Automated versioning with semantic tags
Recovery: Pin to specific versions in deployment repos
Monitoring: Dependency health checks in all consumers
```

#### **Build System Failures**
```yaml
Risk: Turborepo or npm workspace failures
Mitigation: Fallback to individual package builds
Recovery: Manual build process documented for each package
Monitoring: Build health checks and performance tracking
```

#### **Git Remote Configuration Issues**
```yaml
Risk: Remote URLs become misconfigured
Mitigation: Automated remote setup scripts
Recovery: Manual remote reconfiguration commands provided
Monitoring: Regular git remote verification
```

## 🔧 Maintenance & Monitoring

### Health Check Procedures
```bash
# Daily health checks
npm run build                   # Verify all packages compile
npm run test                    # Run full test suite
npm run lint                    # Code quality validation
git remote -v                   # Verify git configuration

# Weekly deployment tests
npm run push:dry-run            # Test deployment without execution
npm run type-check              # TypeScript validation across packages

# Monthly dependency audits  
npm audit                       # Security vulnerability scan
npm outdated                    # Dependency update status
```

Metrics to Track:
  - Build times (target: <2 minutes for full build)
  - Hot reload performance (target: <500ms)
  - Deployment duration (target: <5 minutes for all repos)
  - Type check performance (target: <30 seconds)
  - Test suite duration (target: <10 minutes)

Alerts to Configure:
  - Build failures in any package
  - Deployment script failures
  - Git remote connectivity issues
  - TypeScript compilation errors
